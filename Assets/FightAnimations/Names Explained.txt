In order to minimise the messiness of the fight animation code, we used the IDs from the Units GetOwner().playerID method.

Therefore at each call of the conflict method, these two values are returned and concatenated into a 3 integer string along with randomAnimation
In addition as there are two animation variations, either 1 or 2 is randomly selected in the script and assigned to randomAnimation (the third integer)

When the attacking unit wins, they are concatenated as attackingID + defendingID + randomAnimation

When the defending unit wins, they are concatenated as defendingID + attackingID + randomAnimation

Then the string is searched in the AnimationPlane game object and played
